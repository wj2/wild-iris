I have collected images of and some basic information about all the plants 
mentioned in Louise Gl√ºck's book The Wild Iris (please 
[tell me](mailto:wjeffreyjohnston@gmail.com) if I'm missing any). This 
project is meant as a reference for the curious and -- like me -- botanically 
ignorant reader of this wonderful book. 

__Practical notes:__ There is a navigation bar at the top of each page. Hover over italicized words in "Type" section to see the definition from the glossary. Hover over the number(s) in the "References" section to see the reference.
