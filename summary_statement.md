I have collected images of and some basic information about all the plants 
mentioned in Louise Gluck's book The Wild Iris (please 
[tell me](mailto:wjeffreyjohnston@gmail.com) if I'm missing any). This 
project is meant as a reference for the curious (and botanically ignorant)
reader of this wonderful book.
