This zine collects images of and some basic information about all the plants mentioned in Louise Gl√ºck's book _The Wild Iris_ (please [contact me](mailto:wjj@posteo.net) if you notice any that are missing). The zine is meant as a reference for the curious and -- like me -- botanically ignorant reader of this wonderful book.
