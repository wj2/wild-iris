I have collected images of and some basic information about all the plants 
mentioned in Louise Gl√ºck's book The Wild Iris (please 
[tell me](mailto:wjeffreyjohnston@gmail.com) if I'm missing any). This 
project is meant as a reference for the curious and -- like me -- botanically 
ignorant reader of this wonderful book. 

__Practical notes:__ There is a navigation bar at the top of each page. The definitions from the glossary are also given in the alt-text for the words in the "type" section of each page. The sources listed in the references are also given in the alt-text.
