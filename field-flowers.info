Notes = Hundreds of different flowering plants grow wild in Vermont from
      spring through to fall. Many of the species mentioned elsewhere
      in the book can be found growing wild. Below, we have reproduced
      several species reported to grow in a field in the Landon Community,
      South Hero, Vermont. 
Wild madder (Bedstraw) = Clusters of small, four-petaled white flowers on
     stems. Forms in large patches.
Common fleabane = Bunches of flowers on stems, consisting of hundreds of
       bristle-like rays surrounding a central yellow disk.
Tall buttercup = Yellow flowers with wide petals on tall, erect stalks.
Cow vetch = Clusters of purple-blue flowers that ascend the stem.
